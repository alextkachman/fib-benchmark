Set of benchmarks to compare same algorithms implemented by Java/Groovy 1.8/Groovy 1.7/Groovy++

To run execute './gradlew -q all' from command shell

Following benchmarks are implemented

1) Fib

Calculates 40th Fibbonachi number

2) Quicksort

Sorts array of 10M integers

3) BinaryTrees

Borrowed from Language Shootout Game.
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=binarytrees

Allocates and traverse binary trees of different depth.

4) SpectralNorm

Borrowed from Language Shootout Game
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=spectralnorm

Calculates the spectral norm of an infinite matrix A, with entries a11=1, a12=1/2, a21=1/3, a13=1/4, a22=1/5, a31=1/6

5) ThreadRing

Borrowed from Language Shootout Game
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=threadring

Creates and keep alive 503 pre-emptive threads, linked in a ring,
and pass a token between one thread and the next thread 5000000 times.

6) PiDigits

Borrowed from Language Shootout Game
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=pidigits

Use the same step-by-step spigot algorithm to calculate digits of Pi

7) Fannkuch

Borrowed from Language Shootout Game
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=fannkuchredux&lang=all

Generates permutations

8) Fasta

Borrowed from Language Shootout Game
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=fasta&lang=all

Generates DNA sequences, by weighted random selection from the alphabets, using this linear congruential generator

9) N-body

Borrowed from Language Shootout Game
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=nbody&lang=all

Models the orbits of Jovian planets, using the same simple symplectic-integrator
